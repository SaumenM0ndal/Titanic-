• The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

• On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. Translated 32% survival rate.

• One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew.

• Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

This is one of my first machine learning projects,and its was fun to work on,especially for beginners since we get to do a good amount of feature enginerring on the dataset.
